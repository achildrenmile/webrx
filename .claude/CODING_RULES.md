# Coding Rules

These rules apply to all code changes.

## Scope Control
- Implement exactly what the GitHub issue describes
- Do not add features "for later"
- Do not refactor unrelated code

## Change Discipline
- One GitHub issue = one logical change set
- Stop after completing an issue and wait for confirmation

## Testing
- Calculations and validations require tests
- UI-only changes do not require backend tests

## Safety Rules
- If requirements are unclear, ask before implementing
- Never guess legal or compliance behavior
- Prefer simple, readable code over abstractions
